<h1>Jacklyn Becker</h1>
<p>I currently only have knowledge of creating my own simple IOS apps and some backend SQLite knowledge.</p>
<p>My favourite mobile application is Netflix. I spend a lot of time watching shows on Netflix and I love 
    that theres so many options for things to watch in any occasion. I also love that I can pick up where 
    I left off on the app on my phone, to my computer using the website.</p>
<p>Im really looking forward to expanding my knowledge in app development so I can change my carreer path.</p>
